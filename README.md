# CalgaryGps

This gem utilizes the popular web-scraping ruby gem NOKOGIRI to obtain certain professional details of medical doctors in Calgary, AB, Canada.
It will list doctors and provide his or her name, specialty, and rating out of 5 based on users of https://ratemymd.com.

Users can then drill into any one particular doctor to view his or her biography, if available, and whether or not the doctor is accepting new patients (if this detail is provided.)

Users can also view a list of doctors by specialty.

** The code is a work in progress.  In its current form, the application only scrapes the first page of the link above (actual number of pages varies).  Therefore, only the first page of doctors is displayed.  Suggestions on how to improve user functionality is welcome. **

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'calgary_gps'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install calgary_gps

## Usage

When running the executable file (./bin/calgary_gps), the program will take some time to grab a list of doctors and associated details and list them by number.

LIST DOCTORS:

1. To view details of a particular doctor, select the number corresponding to the doctor you wish to view further details about.
2. The prompt will then show the selected doctor's biography and whether he or she is accepting new patients.
3. To go back to the main menu, hit any key

LIST SPECIALTIES:

1. To view a list of doctors sorted and categorized by a particular specialty, type 'list specialities'.
2. The prompt will then show all of the specialities on the particular page that was scraped and list the doctors belonging to that specialty.
3. To go back to the main menu, hit any key

EXIT
1. To exit the program, type 'exit'
